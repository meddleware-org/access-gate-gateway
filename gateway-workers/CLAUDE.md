# CLAUDE.md — gateway-workers

## Status: superseded, pending cutover (0.0.27)

Replaced 1:1 by the Rust Worker `../worker` (workers-rs on `access-gate-gateway-core`), which is built and tested but not yet deployed; this package is the live deployment and the
rollback until the maintainer's shadow deploy, CPU-time gate and cutover (`../worker/README.md` "Runbook"), then it is retired. Do not add features here. A behavioural change goes
in the core and the Rust Worker; `../worker/tests/differential.diff.mjs` fails when this Worker and the Rust Worker diverge, so a change made here alone is caught.

## What this package is

The Cloudflare Workers implementation of the access-gate gateway. Wire-identical to `gateway-rust/`
on the client-facing contract — same routes, status codes, proof format, and env-var config.
Deployed via Wrangler; state backed by Durable Objects (default) or Workers KV (fallback).

## Chain access: gRPC, not JSON-RPC

`src/chain.ts` (`SuiGrpc`) queries Sui over the **gRPC** API via `@mysten/sui`'s `SuiGrpcClient`.
Public Sui fullnodes have **deprecated JSON-RPC** — `suix_queryEvents`, `sui_getTransactionBlock`,
and `suix_getOwnedObjects` now return `-32601 Method not found` — so the previous JSON-RPC
`SuiRpc` returned `502 on-chain verification failed` for every gated request. `SUI_RPC_URL` keeps
the same fullnode URL (`…:443`); only the transport changed.

Single-use verification is **digest-first**: the access proof carries the `access_gate::consume`
transaction digest, so `consumeEventMatches` fetches that exact transaction (`core.getTransaction`,
`include: { events: true }`) and confirms it succeeded and emitted a matching `AccessConsumedEvent`
(sender + gate; the consume is deliberately **not** bound to the challenge nonce — see
"Redemption" below). This is precise and needs no event-by-sender scan. Ownership (non
single-use) uses `ownsAccessNft` from `@meddleware/access-gate-client` over the same gRPC client:
exact NFT type, every owned-object page read until the first match (a list too long to read
throws, which denies).

The gRPC event shape differs from JSON-RPC (`eventType`/`json` vs `type`/`parsedJson`); the pure
helpers in `chain.ts` read both so they tolerate the documented `json`-shape variation. gRPC
`getTransaction` is retried briefly to absorb fullnode indexing lag after the client's finality
wait. `gateway-rust/` reaches the same data over a hand-rolled gRPC-web client (`sui_rpc.rs`).

## Cloudflare Workers constraints

- **No filesystem.** All config comes from env bindings and secrets, never from files.
- **Isolate-scoped state.** Module-level variables (`cached` in `index.ts`) persist across
  requests within the same isolate but are reset on cold start. Do not store mutable state there
  that requires durability — use Durable Objects or KV.
- **No long-running tasks.** `scheduled` handler is for the quota guard cron only; do not put
  request-path logic there.
- **`waitUntil` is used** on the request path to populate the public-path edge cache
  (`forwardPublic` in `index.ts`) without blocking the response; the quota guard runs separately in
  the `scheduled` handler.

## Secrets pattern

Sensitive config is injected via Wrangler secrets (never hardcoded in source or `wrangler.toml`):

```bash
wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_URL            # the private origin
wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS   # optional: CF Access service token (or the GitHub secret)
wrangler secret put SUI_RPC_AUTH_HEADER     # optional: authenticated RPC
```

Public values are `[vars]` in `wrangler.toml`: `NFT_TYPE` (a public on-chain type; it was a secret
until 0.0.14), `GATE_ID`, `SUI_RPC_URL`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and the limits. A secret and a var may not
share a name, so the Deploy Workers workflow deletes a secret listed in its `RETIRED_SECRETS` from a
pending version before uploading code that defines it as a var.

Non-sensitive defaults are set in `wrangler.toml` under `[vars]`. Do not put secrets in `[vars]`.

`UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS` may instead be a GitHub secret on this repo. When it is set,
`.github/workflows/deploy-workers.yml` validates it with `parseUpstreamAuthHeaders` and ships it
with the code as one Worker version (`versions upload` → `versions secret put` → `versions deploy`);
GitHub is then the source of truth and each deploy overwrites the Cloudflare value. When it is
unset the workflow runs plain `wrangler deploy`, keeping the secrets stored in Cloudflare. Keep
`src/config.ts` free of imports: the workflow loads it under Node type stripping.

## State machine: Durable Objects vs KV

**Default: Durable Objects** (`NONCE_STATE` binding, `NONCE_BACKEND=durable-object`)
- Region-sharded: each continent shard (`nonce:<region>`) is a separate DO instance placed
  near its users.
- The nonce is embedded with a region tag (`<region>.<hex>`) so a consume call routes back to
  the issuing shard even under anycast drift.
- Single-threaded per DO → `takeIfValid` is atomic (the Redis-GETDEL analog): a nonce is
  consumed exactly once.
- Free-tier eligible (SQLite storage).

**Fallback: Workers KV** (`NONCE_KV` binding, `NONCE_BACKEND=kv`)
- Eventually consistent — `get` then `delete` is NOT atomic. In `SINGLE_USE=false` mode, a nonce
  could momentarily read valid in two regions within its TTL.
- `SINGLE_USE=true` refuses this backend: redemptions need the Durable Object's atomic per-key state.
- Use the DO backend when cross-region replay atomicity matters.

**Quota-degrade flag:** When the DO usage approaches a Workers Free daily limit (`WORKERS_PLAN=free`),
the quota guard (cron, off by default) sets a KV key `quota:degrade`; on `WORKERS_PLAN=paid` it only warns. The per-isolate state bootstrap checks this flag once and
may switch to the KV backend for that isolate's lifetime.

## Single-use flow (SINGLE_USE=true)

1. Client calls `GET /v1/challenge` → receives `{ nonce, expiresAt }`.
2. Client signs the audience-bound `access-gate-gateway:access:v3` message (this gateway's origin, gate, network, nonce and the consume digest) as a Sui personal message.
3. Client submits an on-chain `access_gate::consume` transaction, capturing the transaction
   digest (`consumeDigest`). It persists the digest locally so a retry/reload reuses the SAME
   consume (re-signing a fresh challenge is free) instead of spending another use.
4. Client sends `Authorization: Bearer base64(JSON { address, nonce, signature, consumeDigest })`
   to the gated endpoint.
5. Gateway: decode proof → verify signature → consume nonce (anti-replay) → `consumeTxValid`
   (`core.getTransaction`: the tx succeeded and emitted an `AccessConsumedEvent` for this
   **sender and gate**) → **lease the `consumeDigest`** → proxy → **commit** on a 2xx upstream
   response, else **release**.

If the client sends a proof without `consumeDigest` in single-use mode, it is denied with
`ConsumeMissing` (not `BadProof`) — a distinguishable misconfiguration signal.

### Redemption: the consumeDigest is the one-time token (a use is never lost)

The consume event is **not** bound to the challenge nonce — the nonce is only for signature
freshness/anti-replay. Single-use is enforced by the **redemption store** (see the state backend)
keying on the permanent on-chain `consumeDigest`:

- `tryLeaseRedemption` claims the digest for an in-flight upload (`ok` with an owner token /
  `leased` / `redeemed`).
- On a **successful** upload (`response.ok`) the dispatcher `commitRedemption`s it with the token —
  spent, and retained `REDEMPTION_RETENTION_SECS` (default 30d) to block re-redemption. A commit
  whose lease lapsed (`lost`) is a `502`, never success, and leaves the newer holder alone.
- On **failure** it `releaseRedemption`s it with the token, so the same consume is immediately
  retryable — an interrupted upload (reload, tab close, wallet rejection, network blip) never burns
  a use. Commit/release are compare-and-set on the token, so a stale holder cannot clear a newer lease.
- Redemptions live only in the Durable Object (`RedemptionStore`); `loadConfig` refuses
  `SINGLE_USE=true` with the KV backend and the quota-degrade flag is ignored in that mode.
- A consume older than `CONSUME_MAX_AGE_SECS` is refused (the event's `timestamp_ms`), so it cannot
  outlive its redemption record.
- A `redeemed`/`leased` lease result → `409` (`code: "redeemed"` vs `"leased"`); the client clears
  its stored digest and consumes anew only on `redeemed`.

Security: decoupling from the nonce is safe because the event `sender` must equal the
signature-verified proof address (an attacker can't present someone else's consume; a soulbound NFT
can't be transferred), and each digest is redeemable exactly once. The lease self-expires
(`REDEMPTION_LEASE_TTL_SECS`, default 900s, always above `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS`) so a crashed request can't strand a use — the rare cost
is at most one extra upload if a worker dies between upstream success and commit. `gateway-rust`
implements the same lease/commit/release redemption (`NonceStore`, orchestrated in `main.rs`).

Commit failure after a 2xx upstream (decided 2026-10-19, OQ6): `502 redemption commit failed`, lease
released (token-bound). The user may upload twice (bounded by the lease TTL and the per-upload
limits) but never loses a paid use; the alternative of keeping the lease and retrying the commit in
the background could lose it. Same in `gateway-rust`.

Loop marker (F43): `upstreamRequestHeaders` sets `Via: 1.1 access-gate-gateway` after dropping the client's;
`handle` answers `508 loop detected` to a request whose `Via` already names `access-gate-gateway` (after
`/healthz` and the CORS preflight, before any state work). Foreign values pass. Parity table:
`VIA_TABLE` in `test/proxy.test.ts` = `via_loop_table` in `core/src/headers.rs`.

## Conformance test workflow

```bash
npm run test:unit           # local vitest unit tests (including conformance vectors)
npm run test:integration    # vitest with cloudflare-integration pool (requires wrangler)
npm run test:all            # both
node ../scripts/sync-vectors.mjs   # vectors are generated and published by @meddleware/access-gate-gateway-client
# (before a release is published: ACCESS_GATE_GATEWAY_CLIENT_VECTORS=../../access-gate-gateway-client/vectors.json, refused when CI is set)
```

Both test projects consume `../../conformance/vectors.json` — changes there automatically
propagate to both Workers and Rust test suites.

## Key dependency versions

- `@cloudflare/workers-types`: pinned closely (~5.x) — Cloudflare updates these frequently
  and breaking changes arrive without semver guarantees. Pin before deploying.
- `@noble/curves` / `@noble/hashes`: same family used by `@mysten/sui` — intentional for
  consistency (same audited primitives, same hash outputs).
- `@meddleware/access-gate-gateway-client`: `wire.ts` re-exports `personalMessage`,
  `decodeAccessProof`, `AccessProof` directly — no duplication.
- `@meddleware/access-gate-client`: `chain.ts` uses `ownsAccessNft` for the ownership check.

## Invariants

- **Body cap without buffering.** `proxy.ts` rejects a declared `Content-Length` over
  `MAX_BODY_BYTES` up front, and streams every body through `limitBody` (a counting
  `TransformStream`) that aborts the upstream fetch past the cap → `413`. Never read the body into
  memory. Declared-length bodies are re-framed with `FixedLengthStream` so the upstream still sees
  `Content-Length`. The effective limit is `min(MAX_BODY_BYTES, Cloudflare plan limit)` — 100 MB
  on Free/Pro — see README "Request body limit". Tests: `test/proxy.test.ts` (workerd).
- `index.ts` must export `NonceRateState` (the Durable Object class) for Wrangler's DO migration
  to work. Do not rename or split this export.
- `crypto.ts` uses `atob`/`btoa` (present in the Workers runtime, not in Node.js without a
  polyfill). Tests in Node.js context must mock these if needed — unit tests already use the
  cloudflare-integration pool to get the correct runtime.
- Public paths (`isPublicPath`) are exact-string matches, not prefix matches. This is intentional
  — prefix matching would require careful escaping; exact matches are unambiguous.

## What NOT to do

- Do not use `fs`, `child_process`, or any Node.js built-in that is not available in Workers.
- Do not add a build step — the package ships TypeScript source consumed directly by Wrangler.
- Do not store secrets in `wrangler.toml` — use `wrangler secret put`.
- Do not change the nonce format (`<region>.<hex>`) without also changing the shard routing in
  `shardOfNonce` and the Rust gateway's nonce format (and regenerating conformance vectors).
