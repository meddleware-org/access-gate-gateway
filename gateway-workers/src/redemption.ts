/**
 * Single-use: the permanent on-chain `consumeDigest` is the one-time redemption token. Lease it
 * (the lease returns an owner token), proxy, then COMMIT on a successful upload or RELEASE on
 * failure, both presenting the token — so an interrupted upload leaves the consume redeemable (the
 * use is never lost), a duplicate can't double-spend it, and a request whose lease lapsed can never
 * clear or overwrite a newer holder's. The lease outlives the upload deadline (checked at startup).
 *
 * A commit that fails after a successful upload, or finds its lease lost, is reported as `502`,
 * never as success. Store errors propagate to the caller (answered `503`, never as a conflict).
