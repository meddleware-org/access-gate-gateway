Cloudflare Workers implementation of the [nft-gate](../README.md) NFT-gated reverse proxy.
Wire-identical to the [Rust gateway](../gateway-rust/): same routes, status codes, proof format,
Sui RPC calls, and env-var names. Deploy it at the same URL the Rust gateway serves and nothing
else changes.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | 22.x | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| npm | 10.x | bundled with Node |
| Wrangler | 4.x | `npm install -g wrangler` |
| Cloudflare account | — | [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) |

## Getting started

### 1. Get the source

Clone or fork the repo, then work from the `gateway-workers/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meddleware-org/nft-gate.git
cd nft-gate/gateway-workers
npm install
```

Alternatively, the package is published to npm for reference:

```bash
npm install @meddleware/nft-gate-gateway
```

### 2. Configure `wrangler.toml`

Edit the `[[routes]]` stanza to bind the Worker to your hostname:

```toml
[[routes]]
pattern = "gate.example.com/*"
zone_name = "example.com"
```

The default `[vars]` block already contains safe defaults for all optional settings. Review
`SUI_RPC_URL` and change it to your preferred Sui fullnode:

| Network | Public fullnode URL |
| --- | --- |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443` |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` |

### 3. Create the Worker (first deploy)

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Wrangler creates the Worker and the Durable Object namespace in your account. The Worker will
respond to requests immediately but will return errors until the required secrets are set.

### 4. Set required secrets

Run these once from the `gateway-workers/` directory after the Worker exists:

```bash
# The upstream origin the Worker proxies to.
wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_URL
# Value: https://your-relay.example.com

# The pass type (NFT_TYPE), the gate (GATE_ID) and the RPC URL (SUI_RPC_URL) are public values:
# set them in wrangler.toml [vars], e.g.
#   NFT_TYPE = "0x<ACCESS_GATE_ORIGINAL_ID>::access_gate::SoulboundAccessNFT"

# CF Access service-token headers to authenticate to your origin (if Access-locked).
# Omit if your upstream is publicly reachable or uses another auth mechanism.
wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS
# Value (JSON): [{"name":"CF-Access-Client-Id","value":"<id>"},{"name":"CF-Access-Client-Secret","value":"<secret>"}]
```

Secrets are encrypted at rest and never appear in `wrangler.toml` or workflow logs. They survive
`wrangler deploy` — setting them once is sufficient.

### 5. Verify

```bash
curl https://gate.example.com/v1/challenge
# → {"nonce":"...","expiresAt":...}
```

Any gated route without a valid proof token returns `401 Unauthorized`.

## Upstream reachability

The Rust gateway usually runs **inside** your network and reaches a private upstream directly.
This Worker runs at Cloudflare's **edge**, so `UPSTREAM_URL` must be **publicly routable**.

**Recommended pattern**: expose your upstream via a dedicated `cloudflared` public hostname
locked to this Worker via Cloudflare Access, then point `UPSTREAM_URL` at it.

Every upstream request carries `Via: 1.1 nft-gate` (any `Via` the client sent is dropped). A request
that arrives already carrying it has looped back to the gateway (the upstream hostname resolves to
this route) and gets `508 {"error":"loop detected"}` before any work; other `Via` values, such as a
CDN's `1.1 google`, pass.

**Single-use failure outcomes.** If the upstream answers 2xx but the redemption commit then fails,
the client gets `502` and the consume is released, so it can be redeemed again: the user may upload
twice (bounded by the lease TTL and the per-upload limits) but never loses a paid use.

### Locking the origin with a Cloudflare Access service token

1. Cloudflare Zero Trust → Access → Service Tokens → **Create Service Token**.
2. Create an Access **application** for your relay hostname (e.g. `relay.example.com`).
3. Add a policy: allow requests where **Service Token** is the token you just created.
4. Set the Worker secret — both token headers, as a JSON array (a malformed value makes the
   gateway fail closed with `500 gateway misconfigured` until it is fixed):

   ```bash
   wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS
   # [{"name":"CF-Access-Client-Id","value":"<id>"},{"name":"CF-Access-Client-Secret","value":"<secret>"}]
   ```

   Alternatively store the same JSON as the GitHub secret `UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS` and deploy with
   the `Deploy Workers` workflow: it validates the value and ships it with the code as one
   version. While that GitHub secret exists it overrides the Cloudflare value on every workflow
   deploy, so rotate it in GitHub.

5. The Worker injects these headers on every upstream `fetch`. Direct browser or bot traffic to
   the origin gets an Access login page or `403`, depending on the policy fallback.
6. Verify the lock stays in place. `Deploy Workers` checks that the origin **accepts** the token
   (repository variable `UPSTREAM_CHECK_URL`); the `Origin lock` workflow
   (`.github/workflows/origin-lock.yml`, daily and on demand) checks the opposite with
   `scripts/check-origin-locked.mjs`: GET requests without a token, and with an unknown one, must be
   refused by Access (401/403 with `cf-access-domain`, or a redirect to the Access login). It sends no
   secret. A run fails when the origin answers, or is refused by anything other than Access.

## State backend

Single-use nonces and per-address rate limits need atomicity that a stateless isolate cannot
provide. Two backends are available:

| Backend | Binding | Consistency | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `durable-object` (default) | `NONCE_STATE` (auto-created) | Strong — atomic single-use consume | Free tier |
| `kv` | `NONCE_KV` (create manually) | Eventual — weak cross-region replay window in `SINGLE_USE=false` | Free tier |

To use the KV backend, create a namespace and uncomment the binding in `wrangler.toml`:

```bash
wrangler kv namespace create NONCE_KV
# Copy the returned ID into wrangler.toml:
# [[kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "NONCE_KV"
# id = "<returned-id>"
```

Then set `NONCE_BACKEND = "kv"` in `[vars]`.

## Request body limit

`MAX_BODY_BYTES` is enforced twice, without buffering the body:

1. **Declared length.** A `Content-Length` above the cap gets `413 {"error":"request body too large"}`
   before the upstream is contacted.
2. **Streamed bytes.** Every body passes through a byte counter. A body with no declared length
   (`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`) that crosses the cap aborts the upstream request and gets the
   same `413`. Bodies within the cap are forwarded unchanged, still `Content-Length`-framed when the
   client declared one.

The **effective limit is the lower of `MAX_BODY_BYTES` and the zone's Cloudflare plan limit** on
request bodies (Free/Pro 100 MB, Business 200 MB, Enterprise configurable up to 5 GB — see
[Workers limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#request-and-response-limits)).
The deployed value, `104857600` (100 MiB), is at the Free/Pro plan limit, so the edge may reject an
oversized upload first — with Cloudflare's own `413`, not the gateway's JSON body. Raising
`MAX_BODY_BYTES` has no effect beyond the plan limit. Keep the relay origin's own cap
(e.g. `nginx.org/client-max-body-size` on its ingress) at least as large, so the gateway, not the origin, is the
binding limit.

The Rust gateway enforces the same cap with the same status codes (see
[`gateway-rust`](../gateway-rust/README.md)).

## Full configuration reference

| Var | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UPSTREAM_URL` | ✓ | — | Base URL of the protected upstream (set via `wrangler secret put`) |
| `GATEWAY_ORIGIN` | ✓ | — | This gateway's canonical public origin (`https://host`, no path, lower-case); signed into every proof (`nft-gate:access:v2`), so a proof made for another gateway is useless here (`wrangler.toml` `[vars]`) |
| `NETWORK` | ✓ | — | `localnet` \| `devnet` \| `testnet` \| `mainnet`; signed into every proof, and labels the RPC client |
| `SUI_RPC_URL` | ✓ | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` | Sui fullnode (queried over gRPC-web); change to mainnet for production |
| `NFT_TYPE` | ✓ | — | `<pkg>::access_gate::AccessNFT` or `SoulboundAccessNFT`, with `<pkg>` the access_gate original id (a `[vars]` entry in `wrangler.toml`); any other type — e.g. a fungible `Coin<T>` — is rejected at startup |
| `GATE_ID` | ✓ | — | The gate whose passes are accepted; also read live so a paused gate with `pause_blocks_access` denies holders (`403 the gate is paused`) |
| `SINGLE_USE` | | `false` | Require a `consumeDigest` naming a successful `access_gate::consume` by the proof address on `GATE_ID`; each digest is redeemable once |
| `PUBLIC_PATHS` | | `/v1/tip-config` | Comma-separated paths served without authentication |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | | `30` | Requests per verified address per 60s window (`0` disables) |
| `MAX_BODY_BYTES` | | `262144` | Request body cap (256 KiB); `wrangler.toml` sets `104857600` (100 MiB) for Walrus uploads. See [Request body limit](#request-body-limit) |
| `CHALLENGE_TTL_SECS` | | `300` | Nonce lifetime in seconds |
| `OWNERSHIP_CACHE_TTL_MS` | | `0` | Ownership-check cache TTL (`0` = live check on every request) |
| `NONCE_BACKEND` | | `durable-object` | `durable-object` or `kv` |
| `NONCE_SHARD` | | `region` | DO shard granularity: `region` (near users) or `global` (one instance) |
| `NONCE_MAX_ENTRIES` | | `1000000` | Hard nonce entry cap per DO shard (evict oldest when reached) |
| `UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS` | | — | JSON array `[{"name":…,"value":…}]` of headers injected on every upstream request (secret); invalid JSON fails closed |
| `CHALLENGE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | | `30` | Per-client-IP budget for `GET /v1/challenge` (0 disables) |
| `SUI_RPC_AUTH_HEADER` | | — | `Name: value` header added to Sui RPC calls (secret, for authenticated nodes) |
| `QUOTA_GUARD_ENABLED` | | `false` | Enable the scheduled free-tier quota guard (never moves single-use redemptions off the Durable Object) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | | none | Comma-separated canonical browser origins granted CORS (`wrangler.toml` lists Meddleware's apps; an unset value grants none) |
| `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS` | | `600` | Total deadline for one upstream exchange (request body and response); `504` past it |
| `RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS` | | `15` | Deadline for each Sui RPC read |
| `GATED_PREAUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | | `120` | Per-client-IP budget for gated requests, checked **before** signature verification (`0` disables) |
| `REDEMPTION_LEASE_TTL_SECS` | | `900` | Single-use lease; must exceed `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS` (checked at startup) |
| `REDEMPTION_RETENTION_SECS` | | `2592000` | How long a spent consume is remembered |
| `CONSUME_MAX_AGE_SECS` | | `432000` | Oldest accepted consume (5 days, inside public fullnodes' transaction retention); at most the retention |

Every value is validated at startup: a boolean must be exactly `true`/`false`, numbers are integers
within bounds, origins must be canonical, and `SINGLE_USE=true` is refused with `NONCE_BACKEND=kv`
(KV's lease is not atomic). A bad value is a `500 gateway misconfigured`, never a weaker mode.

Vars listed in `wrangler.toml` are overwritten on every `wrangler deploy`. Values that must
survive deployments (credentials, contract addresses) must be set with `wrangler secret put`.

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev          # wrangler dev — local Worker runtime with DO + KV stubs
npm test             # Vitest in the workerd runtime (tests DO, KV, crypto, routing)
npm run type-check   # tsc --noEmit
```

## Optional: quota guard

Setting `QUOTA_GUARD_ENABLED=true` and adding a cron trigger activates `src/quota.ts`. It reads
your account's Workers usage via the Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API and logs a warning when
approaching the free-tier request or CPU-time limits. It can set a `quota:degrade` flag in KV to
prefer the lighter KV backend during high-load periods.

Uncomment in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["*/15 * * * *"]
```

Set the required secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN   # read-only Analytics API token
wrangler secret put CF_ACCOUNT_ID        # your Cloudflare account ID
```
