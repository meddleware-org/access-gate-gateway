A high-performance, generic **NFT-gated reverse proxy** (Rust / Axum / Tokio). Put it in front of
any HTTP upstream to restrict access to holders of an
[`access_gate`](https://github.com/meddleware-org/vault/tree/main/blockchain/sui/contracts/access-gate)
NFT — an upload relay, a website, a game API, anything.

Wire-identical to the [Cloudflare Workers gateway](../gateway-workers/): same routes, status codes,
proof format, Sui RPC calls, and env-var names. Switch between implementations transparently.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Rust stable (≥ 1.88, the `rust-version`) | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) — `rustup update stable` |
| Cargo | bundled with Rust |
| Docker (optional) | for the container deployment path |

## Getting started

### Option A — Docker (recommended for production)

```bash
docker pull meddleware/nft-gate-gateway:latest

docker run \
  -e UPSTREAM_URL=http://your-relay:8080 \
  -e SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443 \
  -e NFT_TYPE=0x<PACKAGE_ID>::access_gate::AccessNFT \
  -e GATE_ID=0x<GATE_ID> \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  meddleware/nft-gate-gateway
```

For horizontal scale-out, add `REDIS_URL` pointing to a Redis or Dragonfly instance so
single-use nonce consumption is fleet-wide atomic:

```bash
docker run \
  -e UPSTREAM_URL=http://your-relay:8080 \
  -e SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443 \
  -e NFT_TYPE=0x<PACKAGE_ID>::access_gate::AccessNFT \
  -e GATE_ID=0x<GATE_ID> \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  meddleware/nft-gate-gateway
```

### Option B — From crates.io

```bash
cargo install nft-gate-gateway

UPSTREAM_URL=http://your-relay:8080 \
SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443 \
NFT_TYPE=0x<PACKAGE_ID>::access_gate::AccessNFT \
GATE_ID=0x<GATE_ID> \
nft-gate-gateway
```

### Option C — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meddleware-org/nft-gate.git
cd nft-gate/gateway-rust
cargo build --release

UPSTREAM_URL=http://your-relay:8080 \
SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443 \
NFT_TYPE=0x<PACKAGE_ID>::access_gate::AccessNFT \
GATE_ID=0x<GATE_ID> \
./target/release/nft-gate-gateway
```

### Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/challenge
# → {"nonce":"...","expiresAt":...}
```

Any gated route without a valid proof token returns `401 Unauthorized`.

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Var | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GATEWAY_ORIGIN` | ✓ | — | This gateway's canonical public origin (`https://host`, no path, lower-case); signed into every proof (`nft-gate:access:v2`) |
| `NETWORK` | ✓ | — | `localnet` \| `devnet` \| `testnet` \| `mainnet`; signed into every proof |
| `UPSTREAM_URL` | ✓ | — | Base URL of the protected upstream; never logged, and must not carry credentials (use `UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS`) |
| `SUI_RPC_URL` | ✓ | — | Sui fullnode (queried over gRPC-web) for ownership and event queries; must not carry credentials (use `SUI_RPC_AUTH_HEADER`) |
| `NFT_TYPE` | ✓ | — | `<pkg>::access_gate::AccessNFT` (or the soulbound type); any other type — e.g. a fungible `Coin<T>` — is rejected at startup |
| `GATE_ID` | ✓ | — | The gate whose passes are accepted; also read live so a paused gate with `pause_blocks_access` denies holders (`403 the gate is paused`) |
| `SINGLE_USE` | | `false` | Require a `consumeDigest` naming a successful `access_gate::consume` by the proof address on `GATE_ID`; each digest is redeemable once |
| `PUBLIC_PATHS` | | `/v1/tip-config` | Comma-separated paths served without authentication |
| `CHALLENGE_TTL_SECS` | | `300` | Nonce lifetime in seconds |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | | `30` | Per-address request budget per 60s window (`0` disables) |
| `MAX_BODY_BYTES` | | `262144` | Request body cap (256 KiB); see [Request body limit](#request-body-limit) |
| `BIND_ADDR` | | `0.0.0.0:8080` | TCP listen address |
| `REDIS_URL` | | — | Redis/Dragonfly URL for a shared nonce store (required for `replicas > 1`) |
| `NONCE_MAX_ENTRIES` | | `1000000` | Hard cap on in-memory nonce entries (evict oldest when reached) |
| `NONCE_PRUNE_INTERVAL_SECS` | | `60` | Background prune cadence for the in-memory store |
| `OWNERSHIP_CACHE_TTL_MS` | | `0` | Ownership-check cache TTL (`0` = live check on every request) |
| `CHALLENGE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | | `30` | Per-client-IP budget for `GET /v1/challenge` and public paths (`0` disables) |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` | | `0` | Reverse proxies in front of the gateway. `0`: the client IP is the TCP peer (forwarding headers ignored). `N`: the Nth `X-Forwarded-For` entry from the right (behind the k8s ingress alone, `1`) |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | | `64` | In-flight request cap; excess requests get `503 gateway overloaded` at once (`/healthz` is exempt) |
| `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS` | | `600` | Whole-request timeout for upstream calls (`504` past it); the redemption lease must exceed it |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | | unset | Comma-separated browser origins granted CORS (exact match, reflected with `Vary: Origin`; preflights answered before auth). Unset: no browser origin is granted — same policy as the Workers gateway |
| `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` | | `16777216` | Cap on a buffered upstream response |
| `UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADERS` | | — | JSON array `[{"name":…,"value":…}]` of headers added to every upstream request (secret; same format as `gateway-workers`); invalid JSON aborts startup |
| `SUI_RPC_AUTH_HEADER` | | — | `Name: value` header added to every Sui RPC call (secret); a bare value is refused |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` | | — | `1` permits `http://` `UPSTREAM_URL` / `SUI_RPC_URL` (localnet, in-cluster upstream); otherwise both must be `https://` |
| `REDEMPTION_LEASE_TTL_SECS` | | `900` | Single-use: lease window for an in-flight consume-digest redemption; must exceed `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS` + `BODY_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS` |
| `CONSUME_MAX_AGE_SECS` | | `432000` | Single-use: oldest accepted consume (5 days); at most `REDEMPTION_RETENTION_SECS` |
| `ALLOW_VOLATILE_REDEMPTIONS` | | `false` | Single-use without `REDIS_URL`: accept that spent consumes are forgotten on restart (development only; otherwise `SINGLE_USE=true` requires `REDIS_URL`) |
| `GATED_PREAUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` | | `120` | Per-client-IP budget for gated requests, checked before signature verification (`0` disables) |
| `RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS` | | `15` | Deadline for each Sui RPC call |
| `HEADER_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS` / `BODY_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS` | | `10` / `30` | A client must send its request head / body within this long (slowloris limits) |
| `MAX_CONNECTIONS` | | `1024` | Open client connections |
| `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS` | | `30` | How long in-flight requests may finish after SIGTERM |
| `REDEMPTION_RETENTION_SECS` | | `2592000` | Single-use: how long a spent consume-digest is remembered |

**Sui RPC URLs:**

| Network | Public fullnode |
| --- | --- |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443` |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` |

For production, use an operator-run fullnode or a dedicated RPC provider rather than a public
fullnode, to avoid rate limits and avoid leaking access patterns.

## Request body limit

Same contract as `gateway-workers`: a declared `Content-Length` over `MAX_BODY_BYTES` gets
`413 {"error":"request body too large"}` before any byte is read, and a body without a declared
length (chunked) is read only up to the cap, then gets the same `413`. Upstream failures are `502`.

**Memory.** Unlike the Workers gateway, this one buffers: the request body is collected in full
before it is forwarded, and the upstream response (capped at `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`) is collected
before it is returned. `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` bounds how many requests are in flight, so peak
body memory is about `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS × (2 × MAX_BODY_BYTES + MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES)`: at the
defaults (64 × (2 × 256 KiB + 16 MiB)) ≈ 1 GiB worst case, typically far less because responses
are small. With the 100 MiB body cap used in front of the Walrus relay, lower
`MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` accordingly (e.g. 8 → ≈ 1.7 GiB) and size the container limit to match.

**Follow-up (not implemented):** stream both directions — pass the request body to the hyper
client as a length-limited stream instead of `to_bytes`, and return the upstream `Incoming` body
directly — so memory stays at one chunk per request regardless of size.

**Timeouts.** Every outbound call has a 10 s connect timeout; Sui RPC calls `RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS` and a 4 MiB response cap; upstream calls `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS`. Inbound, a client must finish its request head within `HEADER_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS` and its body within `BODY_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS`, and at most `MAX_CONNECTIONS` connections are open.

**Scope.** This gateway is for small-body upstreams (a tip-config read, a small API): bodies are buffered. A large-upload relay belongs behind `gateway-workers`, which streams.

## Signature scheme support

| Scheme | Flag | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ed25519 | `0x00` | Verified under ZIP-215 (`ed25519-consensus`), the rule Sui validators apply |
| secp256k1 | `0x01` | Verified; high-S rejected |
| secp256r1 | `0x02` | Verified; high-S rejected |
| Multisig | `0x03` | Recognised, fails closed (not yet supported) |
| zkLogin | `0x05` | Recognised, fails closed (not yet supported) |
| Passkey | `0x06` | Fails closed |

All three verified schemes cover every current Sui browser and hardware wallet keypair. The shared
`conformance/vectors.json` (positive, negative and ZIP-215 vectors) keeps both gateways identical.

## Scaling and liveness

**Single replica** — in-memory nonce store; correct at one instance. This is the default and
sufficient for most deployments.

**Multiple replicas** — set `REDIS_URL` to a Redis or Dragonfly instance. The nonce store
becomes shared and fleet-wide; `GETDEL` ensures atomic single-use consumption, and a Lua
compare-and-delete releases a redemption lease without racing a commit. Startup retries the Redis
connection with backoff (6 attempts, ~16 s); a failed nonce write answers `503` rather than issuing
a nonce that could never verify.

**Shutdown** — SIGINT and SIGTERM trigger a graceful shutdown (in-flight requests finish).

**Ownership cache** — `OWNERSHIP_CACHE_TTL_MS=0` (default) performs a live Sui RPC check on
every gated request. Set a small value (e.g. `2000`) only to collapse burst duplicate lookups,
accepting that brief window of staleness. The cache is never applied to single-use consume checks.

## Build and test

```bash
cargo fmt --check                        # format check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings  # lint
cargo test --locked                      # unit, property, router and hermetic gRPC-web tests + shared vectors
cargo deny check                         # RustSec advisories, licences, sources (deny.toml; CI runs it)
cargo llvm-cov --locked --summary-only   # coverage figure (CI prints it)
cargo build --release --locked           # production binary

# Network-dependent checks (ignored by default):
cargo test -- --ignored live_gate        # gate + ownership requests against the testnet relay gate
# A recent consume (listEvents on <pkg>::access_gate::AccessConsumedEvent, newest first); public
# fullnodes prune old transactions within about a week, so no digest is fixed in the source:
NFT_GATE_LIVE_DIGEST=<digest> NFT_GATE_LIVE_SENDER=0x<sender> NFT_GATE_LIVE_GATE=0x<gate> \
  NFT_GATE_LIVE_PACKAGE=0x<access_gate package> \
  cargo test -- --ignored live_consume   # real-node check of the GetTransaction wire format
REDIS_URL=redis://:<password>@127.0.0.1:6379 \
  cargo test -- --ignored redis_backend  # Redis/Dragonfly backend incl. the Lua lease release
```

The Redis test uses random keys with 60 s TTLs, so it is safe against a shared instance. To run
it against the cluster's Dragonfly (`cache/dragonfly`), tunnel a loopback port-forward over SSH,
then stop the remote `kubectl port-forward` afterwards; it outlives the SSH session.

## Docker

```bash
# Build locally
docker build -t nft-gate-gateway .

# Multi-arch (for CI or arm64 hosts)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t nft-gate-gateway .
```

The image uses a distroless runtime (`gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13:nonroot`). Pin base images
by digest in production to prevent supply-chain drift.

### Verify a published image

Public images (quay.io and Docker Hub, by digest) are scanned with Trivy, then signed keyless with
cosign by the publish workflow, with an SPDX SBOM attestation and a build-provenance attestation.
Verify against the workflow identity before running one:

```bash
cosign verify quay.io/meddleware-org/nft-gate-gateway@sha256:<digest> \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/meddleware-org/nft-gate/\.github/workflows/docker-publish\.yml@refs/tags/v' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson quay.io/meddleware-org/nft-gate-gateway@sha256:<digest> \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/meddleware-org/nft-gate/\.github/workflows/docker-publish\.yml@refs/tags/v' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

The best-effort self-hosted registry copy is the same image by digest (`mirror-private`, no rebuild, signature verified on the copy), so its digest equals the public one.
